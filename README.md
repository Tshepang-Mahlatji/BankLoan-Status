# Bank Loan Status Prediction: Regression Analysis

## Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project aims to analyze and predict the loan amount that customers qualify for based on various factors. The primary focus is on utilizing regression analysis, specifically imputation regression, to handle missing values in the dataset. The goal is to provide accurate and reliable predictions to assist in the decision-making process for loan approvals.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on customers, including demographic details, financial history, and other relevant factors influencing loan qualification. The dataset may have missing values, and imputation regression will be employed to estimate these missing values and enhance the dataset's completeness.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning and Imputation

- Identify and handle missing values using regression imputation techniques.
- Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of variables and identify potential predictors for loan qualification.

### 2. Regression Modeling

- Utilize regression analysis to build a predictive model for loan qualification.
- Identify significant features that contribute to determining the loan amount.

### 3. Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the performance of the regression model using appropriate metrics.
- Validate the model's accuracy and reliability through cross-validation techniques.

### 4. Interpretation and Recommendations

- Interpret the coefficients of the regression model to understand the impact of each variable on loan qualification.
- Provide recommendations and insights based on the analysis.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and other relevant packages for data analysis and regression modeling.
